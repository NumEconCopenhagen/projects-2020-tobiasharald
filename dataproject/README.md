# Data analysis project

Our project is titled Wage and inequality and seeks to explore the differences in wage and gini across the municipalities in Denmark.
We display the development of wages and gini-coefficient across municipalities by both a simple line chart and an interactive linechart that allows the reader to change which municipality to investigate. Furthermore we take out the municipalities where the wage is above 50.000 DKK. 
The code is documented throughout to maintain an oversight. 

The data used in our porject can be found here: https://www.statistikbanken.dk/IFOR41 and https://www.statistikbanken.dk/LIGELB1 

**Conclusion**
From the analysis on the development in wages and gini-coefficient across municipalities in Denmark it can be conluded that the increase in wages follow the same pattern throughout all municipalities in Denmark. But there are still some relatively big gaps when comparing different municipalities. The wage level in Denmark was probably influenced by the financial crisis, but data only goes back to 2009 - we assume that this is a relatively low level, and from 2009 and forward wages have in general increased. 

**Dependencies:** Apart from a standard Anaconda Python 3 installation, the project requires the following installations:

``pip install matplotlib-venn``
