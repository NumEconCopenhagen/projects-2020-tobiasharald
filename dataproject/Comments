You need more structure in your notebook: Write in markdown cells: An introduction, comment on what you do in text, and a conclusion. 
Look at that for the exam hand-in

Peerfeedback:

The best part of the project was:
-that it is well structured and contains a sufficient amount of details. Your steps are never unclear, and you illustrations are useful.
-"illustrations" as the intuition was better with this.
-The best part of the project was that it is very detailed. The headlines gives a very good overview. And your subject is very interesting.
-he project is very well-structured, and the steps/ the code is good described. I like the interactive plot.


The hardest part of the project to understand was:
-There are many tables, which makes it a bit confusing, especially since there are no titles. Most of the tables are just head commands, so that not all observations can be observed.
-There is a minor error, the interactive plot cannot be changed to ‘gini’. This seems to be a coding error.
-the figures are maybe a little bit too small
-It has nothing to do with your code, but I did not understand why you choose to show København, Roskilde, Ishøj and Gentofte in a graph. It will be good with an explanation why only these.
 "the read and clean process", which lacking explanations for commands and the step you did.
The hardest part of the project to understand was finding information in your tables - they could be structured better.

This part of the project could be better documented:
-Maybe report fewer head outputs. It is important during the coding, but when you show your result it can be too much.
-Maybe add a proper table with a title. etc
-The Analysis part could be better documented.
-"the analysis process".
-Structure your tables better, include titles so it is clear what they are showing.

An idea for an improvement/clarification could be:
-Instead of two interactive plots, you could make one plot with the wage evolution of two or even more municipalities. For that you only have to adapt the plot_wage_gini function. You can take as input multiple municipality-names and then plot each wage.
-It will be better if you describe as much as possible with words what you gonna do in the code. Sometimes it is not clear what the codes are doing.
-"better structure" to make the project manageable and specific
-An idea for improvement/clarification would be focusing on fewer more important points in your illustrations/tables instead of including that much.

An idea for an extension could be:
-The table in which the mean, min, and max for each municipality is compared (line 17) could be coded interactively so that one can see every municipality and easily compare it.
-The same for the separate tables for the wage level. Instead of a head command you could make a proper, interactive table.
-The project is very good. Good work. As an extension, you could see the percentage effect year by year of ever municipality on "Hele landet".
-Good project with very exciting topic. But I think, you need to make more explanations.
-I think you did well but you could always comment more on the results.
