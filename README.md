# TOBIASHARALD's Portfolio for Introduction to Programming and Numerical Analysis at University of Copenhagen

Our portfolio contains our inaugral project, data project, model project and our solutions to the two questions given for the exam. 

## Inaugral project

Our inaugural project seeks to examine labor and supply given a maximization problem which the consumer solves. We display the optimal choices of individuals consumption and labor supply in a simple line chart. 
Furthermore the total tax revenue is calculated and we test how the Frisch elasticity of labor supply effects total tax revenue when the value is reduced. Last but not least we advise a politician, who wants to maximize the tax revenue, which values of standard labor income tax, top bracket labor income tax and cut-off for the top labor income bracket she should implement. 

## Data project

We analyze data about wage and inequality in Denmark across the entire country and different municipalities. Visualized by simple line charts and an interactive linechart.   

The data used in our project can be found here: https://www.statistikbanken.dk/IFOR41 and https://www.statistikbanken.dk/LIGELB1

## Model project

This project is based on an old Microeconomics Exam regarding consumer theory. The problem we are solving is based on problem 2 in the winter exam 2016 Microeconomics I. We solve and visualize a consumer and social planner problem, and ends up with an edgeworth box.
