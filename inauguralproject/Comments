Fine project over all. Comments:
1.       I noted in the text that you comment on tax evasion. There is no possible tax evasion in the model. Even though it is an interesting perspective, as it is not in the problem we should not comment on it here (this is general advice when answering problems/exams at polit). That is unless you are asked for “future perspectives” or similar.
2.       Finally, you should insert all of your functions into a .py file (create in Visual Studio Code) and load as a local package in your notebook for better notebook readability.
The above should be looked at again for the exam hand in.

The solution to Question 5 has t0 = 0.78 (approximately), t1=0, kappa=0. 
You have it the “other way around”, with t0 and t1 switching places. A slip up on my part. 
I suspect that you actually have the correct answer but have switched something around somewhere. Check that as well J
