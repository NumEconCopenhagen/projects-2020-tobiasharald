## Inaugural project 

Our inaugural project seeks to examine labor and supply given a maximization problem which the consumer solves. We display the optimal choices of individuals consumption and labor supply in a simple line chart. 
Furthermore the total tax revenue is calculated and we test how the Frisch elasticity of labor supply effects total tax revenue when the value is reduced. Last but not least we advise a politician, who wants to maximize the tax revenue, which values of  standard labor income tax, top bracket labor income tax and cut-off for the top labor income bracket she should implement. 
The cod eis documented throughout to maintain an oversight. 

The **results** of the project can be seen from running [inauguralproject.ipynb](inauguralproject.ipynb).

**Dependencies:** Apart from a standard Anaconda Python 3 installation, the project requires no further packages.
