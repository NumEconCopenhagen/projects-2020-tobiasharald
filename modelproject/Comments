Nice project, but a little on the short side numerically. You have passed, but for the exam you should:
 
 
·       Focus on tidying up your notebook and describe, in markdown text cells, more what is going on
·       Extend your numerical analysis and describe it in detail.

The best part of the project was:
-First of all, I think you did a really good job. I think your model is well documented and the completed tasks are variated and interesting. Your visualization skills are very good.
-Dynamic visualizations
-I couldnt see the floatslider for p1, but that seems like a relly good idea in order to visualize the effect of a change in p1.


The hardest part of the project to understand was:
-I think it's difficult to understand why you make the calculations that you do? I know this course is not all about the intuition behind the code. But it a bit of intuition would make it a lot easier to relate to.
-The extension with social planner. A bit difficult to follow your thoughts.
-I think the part with the social planner is a bit hard to follow. I think youre missing some left hand side variables in order to make it more easy for the reader to follow your steps.
-Also you could state which steps you are going to take and that you want to end up with a edgeworth box right from the beginning.

This part of the project could be better documented
-I think you should elaborate under each header before each problem, then it would be easier to understand the steps you take and that you were going for an edgeworth box from the beginning.
-The social planner extension.
-And idea would be to include the variables themselves in the derivation in the consumer problem. I.e. to write the mathematical expression for the partial derivative wrt to x_1 equal to the result you find. This would make for a better overview during the derivations.


An idea for an improvement/clarification could be:
-Add a bit of intuition. Maybe elaborate on why you make use of the python functions that you do?
-More focus on the numerical approach than part 3.


An idea for an extension could be:
-A further extension could be to variate your model setup. Maybe make a loop of graphs with a different set of parameters. Add shocks to the economy or change budget constraints.
-No - think the extension with social planner is great.
-Not sure if im doing something wrong, but you should ensure your slider code is working properly, since this is important in understanding the effect of p1.
-Minor detail would be to change the labels of the optimal consumption graphs from x1, x2 to the name of the goods.
